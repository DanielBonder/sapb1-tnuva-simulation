# ✅ERP Test Plan for Payroll and Attendance Process

This exercise presents a structured **test plan** for the payroll and attendance business process modeled in the previous assignment. The goal is to identify process instances, test both normative and exceptional flows, and define expected system behavior.

## 🎯 Objective
To simulate real-world scenarios in which the ERP system must handle:
- Accurate employee time reporting
- Payroll calculation and payslip generation
- Detection and correction of anomalies (e.g., overreporting work hours)

---

## 🔍 Process Under Test
**Employee Time and Payroll Management**

Modeled using:
- BPMN diagram (business-level flow)
- EPC diagram (detailed entity and system interaction)

---

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### ✔️ Normal Flow – Valid Shift Reporting
1. Employee clocks in/out normally
2. System calculates regular and overtime hours
3. Payslip is generated without errors
4. Database updates successfully

### ⚠️ Exception Flow – Invalid Time Report (e.g., 25 hours/day)
1. Employee mistakenly clocks in twice
2. System flags inconsistency
3. User or manager corrects data
4. Updated payslip is generated
5. System logs the correction for audit

Each scenario includes:
- Trigger event  
- System response  
- Expected outcome  
- Data changes and validations
