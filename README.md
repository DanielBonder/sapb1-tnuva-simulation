# 🧠 SAP Business One – Tnuva Simulation Project

This academic project demonstrates the use of **SAP Business One (SAP B1)** to simulate and document the implementation of ERP processes in a real-world company.  
We used **Tnuva**, Israel’s largest food manufacturer, as a case study.  
The project was completed as part of an Information Systems course at **Tel-Hai College**, and includes structured analysis, modeling, and system testing across three main exercises.
