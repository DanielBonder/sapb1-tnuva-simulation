# 🔄 Business Process Modeling for Tnuva

This exercise focuses on mapping key business processes at **Tnuva** using two standard modeling approaches: **BPMN** and **EPC**.

## 🎯 Objective
To visually represent two critical business processes using:
- **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)** – suitable for high-level, standardized process flow
- **EPC (Event-driven Process Chain)** – suitable for detailed operational mapping including entities, inputs, outputs, and system/manual distinction

These diagrams reflect realistic ERP-driven workflows and serve as a foundation for system design and testing in later exercises.
